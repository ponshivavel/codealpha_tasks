Handwritten Character Recognition

Objective:
Identify handwritten digits or characters from images.

Approach:
Used deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.

Dataset:

MNIST (handwritten digits)

EMNIST (handwritten characters)

Model Architecture:

Convolutional layers

MaxPooling

Fully connected layers

Softmax output

Key Features:

Image preprocessing and normalization

CNN-based feature extraction

High accuracy on test data

Future Scope:

Extend to full word or sentence recognition

Use CRNN (CNN + RNN) for sequence modeling
